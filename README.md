# Expense Splitter

Often during many occasions, you would have gone out with your friends. At many places all of you would have spent time on various activities. On coming back, it is often tedious to calculate the amount spent by each one of you and to compute how much money each one of you should give others or get from others.
Task is to implement a split-expenses app in Racket.

- The app should accept your names and the activities (say taxi, breakfast, lunch, dinner and movie) you would like to store.
- The app should be interactive in the sense that the above information and the details concerning the above (like the amount spent on each activity and by whom) should be prompted. However, note that more than one of you might have spent for the same activity. For example, watching movies might have involved expenses related to tickets and refreshments from two different friends!!
- The app, after all the inputs, should compute the amount, each of your friends should either pay or get.
- The app should display the summary of calculation in a neat clutter-free form.
